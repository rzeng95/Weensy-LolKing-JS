NOTE : My API development key is publicly viewable... I haven't figured out how to make it private yet. 

I re-did my old Weensy Lolking project (https://weensylk.herokuapp.com/) using Javascript instead of Python.

Added region selection and increased page load speed. Caching has not been implemented so repetitively spamming the search button will return error 500 (rate limiting).
